K-Means Clustering on Mall Customers Dataset
Objective
Perform unsupervised learning using K-Means clustering to segment customers based on income and spending score.



Dataset
Mall_Customers.csv â€“ includes customer features like Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.



Steps Followed
Loaded and preprocessed the dataset.
Selected relevant features: Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100).
Used the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters (K).
Fitted KMeans with optimal K (e.g., K=5).
Visualized the clusters with color coding.
Evaluated clustering using Silhouette Score.



Tools Used
Python
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
PCA (optional for visualization)



Output
Plotted Elbow Graph
Clustered scatter plot of customers
Silhouette Score printed in the console



Result
K-Means successfully segmented the customers into distinct clusters based on income and spending behaviour
